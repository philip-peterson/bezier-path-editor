Instructions
============

Adding points
-------------

Move your cursor to the desired location, and click the left mouse
button to add a control point. The position of this point can be previewed
by the floating red or blue dot that follows the cursor (not shown when control 
point display is off).

When enough points have been entered, the entire curve input so far will be displayed.

After the first point, every third point must be collinear with the previous point.  
Also, if you create a black hole by placing many points at the same location, the next
point's position may be similarly constrained.

When the point's position is constrained (and control point display is on) the preview
point will be displayed in blue instead of the normal red.

Turning on/off the control point display
----------------------------------------

Use the period (.) key to toggle the display of control points.

Rendering Modes
---------------

To switch between modes, use the number keys 1, 2, 3, and 4.

1 Key - Use parametric scheme (default)
2 Key - Use De Casteljau scheme
3 Key - Use OpenGL scheme
4 Key - Use subdivision scheme

Each mode is colored a different color.

Step size / level
-----------------
To increase or decrease the number of steps (for modes 1-3) or
the level of subdivision (for mode 4), use the plus and minus keys
(+ and -). You can also use the equals (=) key instead of the plus.

You can view the current step size / level in the terminal output.

NOTE that if you set the level to a large number in modes 1-3 (e.g.
value 30+) and switch to mode 4, the program will become EXTREMELY
slow and possibly freeze or crash. This is because mode 4 is very
slow for large numbers of iterations.
